One   thing   that   I   can   tell   you   \nwith   confidence   is   that   most   of   them   approach   mutual   fund   investing   (at   least   \nin   the   equity   funds)   with   unrealistic   expectations.

So   \nwhat   is   the   right   expectation/attitude   when   investing   in   an   equity-oriented   \nmutual   fund.   \nWell,   the   true   answer   to   this   question   depends   on   the   exact   subcategory   of   \nthe   mutual   fund   you   are   looking   at.

Here are some of the most important ones:\n\n1. **Return on Investment (ROI)**: The return a fund generates on its investments, expressed as a percentage.\n2. **Net Asset Value (NAV)**: The total value of the fund's assets, minus its liabilities, per share.\n3. **Expense Ratio**: The percentage of your investment that goes towards managing the fund, including fees, commissions, and other expenses.\n4. **Risk-Return Profile**: The fund's potential returns vs. its level of risk, measured using metrics like beta, standard deviation, or alpha.\n5. **Morningstar Ratings**: A rating system that evaluates a fund's past performance, based on its risk-adjusted returns, dividends, and other factors.\n6. **Asset Size**: The total amount of money invested in the fund. Larger funds may have economies of scale, but may also be more susceptible to market fluctuations.\n7. **Diversification**: The fund's ability to spread risk across various asset classes, sectors, and geographies.\n8. **Manager Tenure**: The length of time the fund manager has been managing the fund. Longer tenure can indicate greater stability.\n9. **Manager Style**: The investment philosophy and approach of the fund manager, such as value, growth, or index fund.\n10. **Peer Comparison**: A comparison of the fund's performance with similar funds in the same category.\n11. **Return Before Fees**: The fund's return, excluding the expense ratio.\n12. **Alpha**: A measure of the fund's excess returns, relative to a benchmark or the market.\n13. **Standard Deviation**: A measure of the fund's volatility, or its historical fluctuations in returns.\n14. **Sharpe Ratio**: A measure of a fund's risk-adjusted performance, considering both return and volatility.\n15. **Drawdown**: The maximum peak-to-trough decline in the fund's value, expressed as a percentage.\n16. **Credit Quality**: The quality of the bonds or debt securities held by the fund, which can affect its creditworthiness.\n17. **Lipper Ratings**: A rating system that evaluates a fund's consistency and risk-adjusted performance.\n18. **Fees and Charges**: The total cost of buying, selling, and holding the fund, including commissions, management fees, and other expenses.\n19. **Tax Efficiency**: The fund's ability to minimize capital gains distributions, which can reduce your tax liability.\n20. **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Factors**: The fund's consideration of ESG factors in its investment decisions, which can align with your values and investing goals.\n\nWhen evaluating a mutual fund, consider the following:\n\n* What are the fund's investment objectives, and does it align with your goals?\n* What is the fund's risk profile, and is it suitable for your tolerance?\n* How does the fund perform compared to its peers and benchmarks?\n* What are the fees and expenses, and are they reasonable?\n* Who is the fund manager, and what is their track record?\n* How does the fund's portfolio composition align with your investing preferences?\n\nBy considering these metrics and evaluating the fund's performance and characteristics, you can make a more informed decision when buying a mutual fund.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":135},{"cell_type":"code","source":"retrieved_context = \" \".join([node.text for node in norank_retrieved_nodes])\ncontext_list = [node.text for
