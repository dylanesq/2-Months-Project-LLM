However if the \\nworking capital is negative, it means the company has a working capital deficit. \\nUsually if the company has a working capital deficit, they seek a working capital loan \\nfrom their bankers. \\nThe concept of ‘Working Capital Management’ in itself is a huge topic in Corporate \\nFinance. It includes inventory management, cash management, debtor’s \\nmanagement etc. The company’s CFO (Chief Financial Officer) strives to manage the \\ncompany’s working capital efficiently. Of course, we will not get into this topic as we \\nwill digress from our main topic. \\nThe working capital turnover ratio is also referred to as Net sales to working capital. \\nThe working capital turnover indicates how much revenue the company generates \\nfor every unit of working capital. Suppose the ratio is 4, then it indicates that the \\ncompany generates Rs.4 in revenue for every Rs.1 of working capital. Needless to \\nsay, higher the number, better it is. Also, do remember all ratios should be \\ncompared with its peers/competitors in the same industry and with the company’s \\npast and planned ratio to get a deeper insight of its performance. \\nThe formula to calculate the Working Capital Turnover: \\nWorking Capital Turnover = [Revenue / Average Working Capital] \\nLet us implement the same for Amara Raja Batteries Limited. To begin with, we \\nneed to calculate the working capital for the FY13 and the FY14 and then find out \\nthe average.

Higher the working capital turnover ratio \\nthe better it is, as it indicates the company is generating better sales in comparison \\nwith the money it uses to fund the sales. \\nTotal Assets Turnover \\nThis is a very straight forward ratio. It indicates the company’s capability to generate \\nrevenues with the given amount of assets. Here the assets include both the fixed \\nassets as well as current assets. A higher total asset turnover ratio compared to its \\nhistorical data and competitor data means the company is using its assets well to \\ngenerate more sales. \\nTotal Asset Turnover = Operating Revenue / Average Total Assets \\nThe average total assets for ARBL is as follws – \\n112', 'Key takeaways from this chapter \\n1.

The net cash flow for the company is the sum of operating activities, investing \\nactivities and the financing activities \\n5. Investors should specifically look at the cash flow from operating activities of the \\ncompany \\n6. When the liabilities increase, cash level increases and vice versa \\n7. When the assets increase, cash level decreases and vice versa \\n8. The net cash flow number for the year is also reflected in the balance sheet \\n9.
