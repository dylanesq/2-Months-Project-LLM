It indicates the amount of working capital available to a company to meet its short-term obligations. If the working capital is positive, it means the company has sufficient working capital to meet its short-term obligations. If it is negative, it means the company has a working capital deficit and may need to seek a working capital loan from its bankers.\\n---------------------\\nAnswer the question: what is working capital? what does it tell you about a company?\\n\\nThe working capital is the difference between current assets and current liabilities. It indicates the amount of working capital available to a company to meet its short-term obligations. If the working capital is positive, it means the company has sufficient working capital to meet its short-term obligations. If it is negative, it means the company has a working capital deficit and may need to seek a working capital loan from its bankers.\\n\\nThe working capital turnover ratio is also referred to as Net sales to working capital. The working capital turnover indicates how much revenue the company generates for every unit of working capital. Suppose the ratio is 4, then it indicates that the company generates Rs.4 in revenue for every Rs.1 of working capital. Needless to say, higher the number, better it is. Also, do remember all ratios should be compared with its peers/competitors in the same industry and with the company’s past and planned ratio to get a deeper insight of its performance.\\n\\nThe formula to calculate the Working Capital Turnover: \\nWorking Capital Turnover = [Revenue / Average Working Capital] \\n\\nLet us implement the same for Amara Raja Batteries Limited. To begin with, we need to calculate the working capital for the FY13 and the FY14 and then find out the average. Here is the snapshot of ARBL’s Balance sheet, I have highlighted the current assets (red) and current liabilities (green) for both the years: \\n\\nThe average working capital for the two financial years can be calculated as follows: \\nCurrent Assets for the FY13 Rs.1256.85 \\nCurrent Liabilities for the FY13 Rs.576.19 \\nWorking Capital for the FY13 Rs.680.66 \\nCurrent Asset for the FY14 Rs.1298.61 \\nCurrent Liability for the FY14 Rs.633.70 \\nWorking Capital for the FY14 Rs.664.91 \\nAverage Working Capital Rs.672.'"
